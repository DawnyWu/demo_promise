# DemoPromise

A toy implementation of (an approximation of) the ECMAScript 6 promise API, for educational purposes:

* `spec/demo_promise_spec.js` contains usage examples.
* The following blog post explains how it works: “[ECMAScript 6 promises (2/2): the API](http://www.2ality.com/2014/10/es6-promises-api.html)”

## Running the tests

Installing Babel and Jest:

```
cd demo_promise/
npm install
```

Running the tests:

```
npm test
```
